It is estimated that ( 75 percentages of parents often complain their children’s unreasonable behavior while children usually think their parents too old fashioned ). Why have there been so much misunderstanding between parents and children? Maybe the reasons can be listed as follows. The first one is that ( the two generations, having grown up at different times, have different likes and dislikes , thus the disagreement often rises between them ). Besides ( due to having little in common to talk about, they are not willing to sit face to face ). The third reason is ( with the pace of modern life becoming faster and faster, both of them are so busy with their work or study that they don’t spare enough time to exchange ideas ). To sum up , the main cause of XX is due to ( lake of communication and understanding each other ). It is high time that something was done upon it. For one thing ( children should respect their parents ). On the other hand , ( parents also should show solicitue for their children ). All these measures will certainly bridge the generation gap. 2.1.2 模块 ( 2 ) In recent years, xx has caused a heated debate on ( 1 ). The factors for ( 2 ). First of all, ( 3 ).

The factors for ( parents’ worry is that children are indulge in television and spend too much time on it. ). First of all , ( with so many programs to choose from, children are not getting as much exercise as they should ). Then, there comes a case that ( some studies have show that excessive watching of television by millions of children has lowered their ability to achieve in school ).

We should do something such as ( planting more trees, equipping cars with pollution-control devices and learning to recycling natural resources )to improve the present situation , and i do believe everything will be better in the future. 2.2 话题作文之模块句型 2.2.1 开头句型 1、Many people insist that… 很多人(坚持)认为…… 这句话乍看没亮点，但将众人皆知的“think”换为“insist”有没有觉得高大上了许多? 2、With the development of science and technology, more and more people believe that… 随着科技的发展,越来越多的人认为…… 这个可是小编当年的“杀手锏”啊，虽谈不上洋气，但正确率百分百啊，还超好记! 3、A lot of people seem to think that… 很多人似乎认为…… “think”终于闪亮登场，但“seem to”为整个句子增添了点婉转之感，这种客观的方式貌似较受老外(尤其腐国人)喜爱。 2.2.2 引出不同观点 1、People’s views on… vary from person to person. Some hold that… . However, others believe that…. 人们对……的观点因人而异。有些人认为…..然而其他人却认为…… 看这个长度就已然鹤立鸡群。其实，也是一个蛮简单也好记的模板。 2、Attitudes towards (drugs) vary from person to person. 人们对待吸毒的态度因人而异。 乍一看，跟上句的开头神似，其实就是省略掉了“people’s”，不仅清爽而且好像高端了一些。 3、People may have different opinions on… 人们对……可能会有不同的见解。 又是一个婉转的句子，展示其客观性。 4、There are different opinions among people as to… 关于……人们的观点大不相同。 “different”虽拉低了水准，但“as to”又拯救了回来。 5、Different people hold different attitudes toward (failure). 对(失败)人们的态度各不相同。 2.2.3 得出最终结论 1、Taking all these factors into consideration, we naturally come to the conclusion that… 把所有这些因素加以考虑，我们自然会得出结论…… 很完全的答法，“take sth into consideration”短语的应用，加分。 2、Taking into account all these factors, we may reasonably come to the conclusion that… 考虑所有这些因素，我们可能会得出合理的结论…… “Take into account sth”短语似乎又比上句的“take sth into consideration”提升了一个层次。 3、Hence/Therefore, we’d better come to the conclusion that… 因此，自然我们得出以下结论… “Hence”一词用在文章中大气吧，但别平时口语中用，否则即使老外也用一种看老古董的眼神看你… 再特意提一句：“we’d better”在这里不是“不得不”或“最好”的意思，而是一种自然而然，水到渠成的得出结论。 4、There is no doubt that (job-hopping) has its drawbacks as well as merits. 毫无疑问，跳槽有优点也有缺点。 短语“there is no doubt that”上线，同时运用我们的老朋友“as well as”增加看点。 5、All in all, we cannot live without… But at the same time we must try to find out new ways to cope with the problems that would arise. 总之，我们没有……是无法生活的。但同时，我们必须寻求新的解决办法来对付可能出现的新问题。 2.2.4 提出建议 1、It is high time that we put an end to the (trend). 该是我们停止这一趋势的时候了。 “It is high time” 打头，为该句增色。注：that 后跟虚拟语气，后跟动词的一般过去式，表示“是某人做……的时候了”或者“是某人不做……的时候了” 2、It is time to take the advice of … and to put special emphasis on the improvement of … 该是采纳……的建议，并对……的进展给予非常重视的时候了。 去掉一个“high”，画风完全不一样，不用过去式，只需用“to do”来替代。 3、There is no doubt that enough concern must be paid to the problem of … 毫无疑问，对……问题应予以足够的重视。 “there is no doubt that”+被动还是蛮经典的组合。 4、Obviously,…. If we want to do something… , it is essential that… 显然，如果我们想做某事，我们需要…… 这句有些老生常谈，稍微不“常”的就是“essential” 替代了“important”。 5、Only in this way can we… 只有这样,我们才能… Only+倒装，经典万能句式，还能看出点水平呢。 6、It must be realized that… 我们必须意识到… 把人人都会的“I realized”升格为被动语态，省略了主语，监考老师绝对会眼前一亮的! 2.2.5 预示后果 1、Obviously, if we don’t control the problem, the chances are that… will lead us in danger. 很明显，如果我们不能控制这一问题,很有可能我们会陷入危险。 “the chances are that”替代了“may”，果然说话拐弯的生物不止是中国人。 2、No doubt, unless we take effective measures, it is very likely that… 毫无疑问，除非我们采取有效措施，否则很可能会…… 作文结尾万用句，毫无破绽。 3、It is urgent that immediate measures should be taken to stop the situation. 应立即采取措施阻止这一事态的发展。 “It is urgent that”+被动，效果不错滴。 2.2.6 解决问题 要求考生列举出解决问题的多种途径 问题现状 怎样解决(解决方案的优缺点) In recent days, we have to face I problem_______A, which is becoming more and more serious.

And the tremendous growth of student use of computers has always aroused the greatest concern. What impresses us most is the number of hours students spend on computers. In 2002, they spend as many as 14 hours per week on computers. The reasons why computers as widely used are varied. Among them, the decreasing price of PC plays an important part. What ’s more, the Internet provides college students an amazing world to explore. For example, they can get the latest news and make friends conveniently around the world. When talking about the disadvantages and problems existing in student use of computers, I think that their lack of skills and discipline is what should be paid attention to. On the one hand, the lack of skills fails students to make good use of the computer and the Internet. On the other hand, their lack of necessary discipline makes some students indulge in computer games and the net world, forgetting their major tasks as college students. In brief, there is still a lot to do to help students make good use of computers. 范文 2 From these graphs, we can draw a conclusion that, with the growth of human population, the number of species has decreased rapidly in America, and some species have even vanished from our planet. There are numerous reasons accounting for the phenomenon and I would like to explore a few of the most important ones here. Above all, as the human population grows rapidly, a growing number of people came to live where some wild species have been living. Then these species have to move to other places. Some of them probably can not adapt to the new environment and die. In addition, although many people look on the wildlife as their friends, some people may not think so. They catch a lot of wild animals and sell them in order to get more money. Consequently, the natural balance and the ecologic environment are destroyed. The clear cutting has become increasingly serious. So some of the wildlife become homeless and extinct. In order to protect the wildlife, I have some suggestions. First, the governments should make laws to prevent them from being caught and killed. Second, the governments should educate people to love nature and protect it. Third, as for ourselves, we should take practical actions to protect our living environment. 2.7.3 常用句型 图形种类及概述法 图表类型： table、chart、diagram graph、column chart、pie graph、bar plot 描述： show、describe、illustrate、can be seen from、clear、apparent、reveal、 represent 内容： figure、statistic、number、percentage、proportion The table/chart diagram/graph shows (that) According to the table/chart diagram/graph As (is) shown in the table/chart diagram/graph As can be seen from the table/chart/diagram/graph/figures，figures/statistics shows (that) It can be seen from the figures/statistics We can see from the figures/statistics It is clear from the figures/statistics It is apparent from the figures/statistics table/chart/diagram/graph figures (that) table/chart/diagram/graph shows/describes/illustrates how 表示逐句增长 The number of ( ) has grown steadily from to in 2009. has risen from (). shows a tendency to increase.

Undoubtedly, the Net are revolutionizing the daily lives of the people who have an access to it. The primary reason behind the Internet boom roots in its multifunction. It provides a vehicle for netizens to shop, search, publish blogs and browse Webpages. A range of problems lurking behind the frenzy of Internet impressively stand out. A vast majority of Internet users’ mail boxes are saturated with junk mails, an issue which sparks strong criticism and generates the loss of corporate productivity. It’s not alone. Porn websites lure a growing number of young people’s visits. False news via the e-mail, BBS and chat room increasingly poses a threat to the social prosperity and stability. To crack down them, we should push for a more effectively tough law. We should join our forces to launch a nation-wide campaign, including imposing stiff penalties on spammers, shutting down or blocking the lewd sites and introducing a real-name registration system to curb fraudulent messages. We can fully believe that our combined efforts will reap rewards. A clean cyberspace will paint our lives more colorfully.

The lists have photos and basic information of offenders e. g, drivers brealdng traffic rules have their license-plate nurabers listed along with the time and location of the infraction. This has attracted particular public attention. Some welcome the policy, believing it will deter people from poor behavior They say it will force people to behave themscives, or they will risk being named and shamed in the media. However, critics have complained that the initiative is an abuse of administrative power and is irresponsible* Citizens should certainly be held responsible for misconduct, they say, but the government should also create an environment to help people exercise self-discipline. Personably I agree that citizens should be responsible for their improper behavior but governments also do have a responsibility to improve their management. Besides, according to laws, law enforcement departments are entitled to give the proper punishments to violators of public regulations. It is, however, groundless for these governmental organs to publicly disgrace the rule- braces. 3.3 人生哲理类：成功因素 Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the saying “The most successful persons may not be the smartest ones.” You can give one example or two to illustrate your point of view. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words. 高分范文 According to a survey conducted among a group of people who were in the same college 10 years ago, those whose grade-point average was in the middle fifty percent, all become rich or managers of different fields, while not a single young man of the upper ten percent becomes an executive or boss. One ingredient, among other things, is good interpersonal skills. With a wide circle of friends who can be trusted to provide information and resources, your chances of success are much higher. On the contrary, if you are competent in your profession, but have difficulty in getting along with your colleagues and even your boss, you can hardly survive the corporation. Another component is the ability to express oneself. In today’s world, what really counts is the ability to express oneself rather than technical competence or professional knowledge. The larger the organization of which you are an employee, and the fiercer the competition, the more important it will be that you know how to convey your thoughts and convince others of your ideas. To sum up, according to my observation, academic brightness is only part of the story, the other factors are very important. 参考译文 根据一项调查，十年前在同一大学中学习的一群人中，那些平均学分处于中间50%的人们都变得富有，或者成为不同领域的经理。然而没有一个处于前10%的年轻人成了经理或老板。 诸多因素之一就是良好的人际关系。拥有广泛的朋友圈可以信任并提供信息和资源，你的成功机会就会更大。相反，如果你在职业上很有能力，但是和同事甚至老板相处困难，就很难在公司中生存。另一个因素是自我表达能力。在当今世界，最重要的是表达自我的能力，而不是技术能力或专业知识。你所处的公司越大，竞争越激烈，你知道如何表达你的想法并使别人信服的能力就越发重要。 总之，根据我的观察，学习优秀只是一个方面，其他因素也非常重要。 亮点词汇 according to根据 conducted进行 grade-point average平均学分 executive经理 ingredient因素 interpersonal skills人际关系 wide circle of friends朋友圈 on the contrary相反 competent有能力的 profession职业 have difficulty in在…方面有困难getting along with与…和睦相处 survive生存 corporation公司 component因素 count重要 rather than而不是 technical competence技术能力 professional knowledge专业知识 competition竞争 convey表达 convince使信服 to sum up总之 academic brightness学习优秀 3.4 明星客座教授 作文题目： Hiring Celebrities as Visiting Professors 1. 目前有不少大学请明星当客座教授 2. 对这一现象人们看法不同 3. 我的看法 高分范文 Hiring Celebrities as Mating Professors Via Internet or other means of mass media，it is common to team that some super stars are employed as a guest professor of a university Whether it is helpful to hire personages for a university’s development on hot debate from the very beginning. There are two voices: Some people think that stars’ social influence can do good to the enrollment of a university and raise its social degrees of approval. Besides, universities should open to society and take advantage of various social resources，inclusive of celebrities1 life experience and struggling adventure. However, others hold the opposite viewpoint. They think that a professor under a star’s name is just ai) advertising stunt, and has no practical meaning to the development of the university. It also diverts students* attention from their academic study. In my view, just as a coin has two sides, the inviting of celebrities as guest professors has both good and bad effect. Thus I think colleges should evaluate the possible results thoroughly, and their choices should be based on the improvement of teaching standards and students, development. Universities should also take the features of their relevant disciplines into consideration before hiring some celebrity as a visiting professor. 3.5 数字媒体 作文题目： Digital Media 高分范文 Nowadays, digital media has permeated almost every aspect of our daily life. It is changing the way that individuals, especially young people, learn, play, socialize, and participate in the society. As a result, the function of digital media has turned into a major topic for the public. Some people pay tribute to its positive role as very convenient news sources, being available almost anywhere and anytime. While some people condemn the negative influence it has brought on privacy, morality, and independent thinking, which some people used to have and enjoy. And still others have been fighting between the merits and demerits of digital media for a final conclusion. In my view, digital media is good for us students as it introduces a new way of learning which encourages more interaction and participation rather than rote learning. Besides, digital media makes it easier to produce and share things. 3.6 人生哲理[幸福感] Directions: For this part you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on Happiness by referring to the saying “Happiness is not the absence of problems, but the ability to deal with them.” You can cite examples to illustrate your point and then explain how you can develop your ability to deal with problems and be happy. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words. 高分范文 As an old saying goes, “Happiness is not the absence of problems, but the ability to deal with them.” Why is difficult to define, or rather discover and achieve happiness? I maintain the major determinant lies in a person’s attitudes. There is little correlation between the circumstance of people’s lives and how happy they are. Instead, happiness lies in the struggle to be happy. To demonstrate, people sometimes go to extremes, and frantically pursue money, power, high social status, and so on, which are all symbols of success—but never of happiness. Perhaps if they shifted their life goal from ultimate success to unswerving efforts and to confidence that they will be successful one day they would be a great deal happier. Besides defining it, how do I achieve happiness? There is little doubt that various people have diverse ways of going about this task. As for me, the most significant secret is realizing that happiness is a by-product of something else. The most obvious sources are those pursuits that give our lives a purpose. These can be anything from playing tennis to studying insects. The more passions we have, the more happiness we are likely to experience. 参考译文 正如古语所说：“幸福并非没有问题出现，而在于有解决问题的能力”。为何很难定义、发现和获得幸福呢?我认为最重要的因素在于一个人的态度。 人们的生活环境和他们的幸福之间没什么关系。相反，幸福在于追求幸福的奋斗之中。例如，人们有时候会走极端，疯狂追求金钱、权利、很高的社会地位等。这些都是成功的象征，但并非幸福的象征。如果他们把人生目标从终极成功转向不懈的努力，并相信未来他们必将成功，他们将会更加幸福。 除了定义幸福之外，我如何来获取幸福呢?毫无疑问，不同的人对于实现这一目标有着迥然不同的方式。对我而言，最大的秘诀就是认识到幸福只是其他事情的一种副产品。最明显的来源就是给予我们目标的那些追求。这些追求可以是从打网球到研究昆虫的任何事情。我们越有激情，就越有可能感受到幸福。 亮点词汇 achieve happiness 获得幸福 major determinant 主要因素lie in在于circumstance 环境instead 相反struggle 奋斗to demonstrate 例如frantically 疯狂地social status 社会地位symbol 象征 life goal 人生目标ultimate success 终极成功unswerving 坚定不移的confidence 自信successful 成功的go about this task 完成任务as for me 就我而言significant 重要的by-product 副产品pursuit 追求insect 昆虫passion 激情be likely to 可能 experience 体会;经验 3.7 人生哲理[有意义的生命] Directions: For this part you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the remark“The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.” You can give examples to illustrate your point. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words. 高分范文 The famous saying “The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it” is rather thought-provoking, which tells us the real meaning of life. It is contemporary social issue in China with common interests and permanent value. In my view, there are good reasons to undertake meaningful things that exert positive and profound influence on society, such as protecting the environment, helping vulnerable groups as well as promoting education. To illustrate, Abraham Lincoln never wavered in his devotion to democracy and equality, whose life has become an inspiration in the United States and throughout the whole world. His life, though limited, definitely lasts longer, and is a life worth living. Likewise, a young person who aspires to be a great writer might decide to buy some literary books or spend weekends writing and refining his works. Without any aspiration, he might simply end up spending all his spare time surfing online or playing Internet games. In brief, a meaningful life serves to motivate and guide us in our daily lives. It provides us with the focus and direction that enable us to work towards accomplishing a special goal, objective or task. 参考译文 “将生命花在比生命更长远的事上，就是尽用生命”这一名言相当发人深思。它告诫我们人生的真正意义。这是人们普遍关注并拥有永恒价值的一个问题。 在我看来，我们有充分的理由从事对社会产生积极深远影响的、有意义的事情，例如保护环境、帮助弱势群体及发展教育。例如，亚伯拉罕·林肯从未放弃投身于民主及平等事业。他的人生成为对美国以及整个世界的一种鼓舞。他的生命尽管有限，但无疑长久延续并意义非凡。同样，一个渴望成为伟大作家的人，或许会决定买一些文学书或把整个周末的时间用于写作并润色自己的作品。而如果没有志气的话，他也许只会将所有的闲暇时间用于上网或玩网络游戏。 总之，有意义的人生在日常生活中激励和指导着我们。它为我们提供了专注的焦点和方向的指引，使我们能够通过努力实现一个具体目标或任务。 亮点词汇 thought-provoking 发人深思的contemporary 当代的social issue 社会问题 common interests 普遍关注in my view 在我看来undertake 从事exert positive and profound influence on 产生积极深远的影响protect the environment 保护环境vulnerable group弱势群体 as well as 以及promote education发展教育 waver 动摇democracy 民主equality 平等inspiration 鼓舞;灵感definitely 无疑aspire 渴望literary 文学的surf online 网上冲浪serve to 用来motivate 鼓舞focus 焦点enable 使能够accomplish 完成 3.8 是否去扶跌倒的老人 Should We Help the old People Up from a Fail? 1.是否应该去扶跌倒的老人引起了激烈的争论 2.出现这种现象的原因 3.我的观点 高分范文 Should We Help the Old People Up from a Fall? As regards whether we should help the old people up from a fall，there has been a heated discussion among the public in our society. People，who are hesitant about helping the aged people up，have their own reasons. For the main reason. They worry that helping aged people will probably get into troubles. And indeed it is successively reported that several help-givers have been falsely identified as offenders and sentenced to pay economic compensation. This phenomenon stops people’s attempt to help the old. As far as I’m concerned，such tragedies should never occur. Firstly，to achieve it，the behavior of helping the aged people in need should be advocated. More importantly，efforts should be made to protect the benefits of those who give help. Only in this way can we make sure that， on the one hand，the old people receive timely aid，and on the other hand， warm—hearted people never suffer from loss. 3.9 情景作文[教育文化] Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the saying “As long as college students are cautious, real-world experience can greatly benefit their future careers.” You can cite one example or two to illustrate your point of view. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words. 高分范文 The typical college student spends most of his or her time studying and, occasionally, participating in various sports or extracurricular activities. Increasingly, however, it has become common for university students to take on part-time jobs or even start their own businesses prior to graduation. Students who launch their own businesses or take on part-time jobs can gain valuable insight into their future career path. To illustrate, by taking a summer job as an accountant or marketing analyst, business majors could see whether a particular field interests them on more than an academic level. Despite the benefits to students of “getting their feet wet” in the business world, it is critical to maintain academic studies as a top priority. Students who already have a heavy course load should limit their number of work hours and, if possible, ask for a leave of absence during examination periods. Ultimately, every student must decide how best to allocate his o her time outside of class. For those with a manageable schedule, exploratory mind and entrepreneurial spirit, work experience prior to graduation can offer important career benefits –not to mention a paycheck. 参考译文 大学生一般会将大部分时间用于学习，有时候也会参加各类体育活动或课外活动。但是，大学生兼职或在毕业前就开始创业的现象也日益普及。 创业或兼职的学生对自己未来的职业道路能有清晰的认识。例如，主修商业的学生若在暑期兼职做过会计或市场分析师，就能知道某个专业领域在现实中是否能真正地吸引他们，而不仅仅只从学术的抽象角度去看待这些专业。尽管学生能在涉足商界的经历中获益匪浅，但将学习放在首位仍非常关键。课业繁重的学生应该控制工作时间并尽量在考试期间请假。 最终，每位学生都必须知道如何才能最好地分配课余时间。对于那些能合理安排时间，有探索精神和创业理想的同学而言，毕业前的工作经验会使他们在未来的职场中受益匪浅，更别提他们已得到的那份薪水了。 亮点词汇 typical 典型的 occasionally 有时候 participate in 参加 extracurricular activities 课外活动 take on part-time jobs 兼职打工 start/launch one’s own businesses 创业 prior to 在……之前 gain valuable insight 获得清晰的认识 career path 职业道路 marketing analyst 市场分析师 business major 主修商业的学生 academic level 学术角度 getting their feet wet 获益匪浅 business world 商界 critical 关键的 maintain 保持 academic studies 学业 top priority 首位 heavy course load 繁重的课业 ask for a leave of absence 请假 ultimately 最终 allocate 分配 with a manageable schedule 合理安排时间 exploratory mind 探索精神 entrepreneurial spirit 创业理想 offer important benefits 使受益匪浅 not to mention 更别提 paycheck 薪水 3.10 社会上的各种培训 white-hot Training in the Society 1.目前社会上的各种培训趋于白热化 2.阐明这种现象产生的原因 3.说明这种现象带来的影响 高分范文 White-hot Training in the Society A recent survey indicates that all increasingly large number of people attend various training enthusiastically. And there has been a heated argument about whether people should attend it. Different people hold different views due to their financial conditions and personal inclinations. Many people attend various training willingly for the sake of a high mark on the academic records or getting different certificates. As for me, I am in favor of going against training. For one thing，the aim of training is to help people pass all kinds of examinations and it mainly focuses on the teaching of examination skills， and it never trains people to think creatively and even restricts their efforts in getting command of the knowledge. For another，people spend so much time participating in various training that they cannot spare enough time for the new or creative job. Moreover，the tuition fees of the training are usually high，thus laying great financial burden on people. From the above analysis，attending training will do people no good， and it is time-consuming as well as costly. Therefore，more and more people should be aware of the disadvantages of various training. 3.11 啃老族 My View on NEET 1.目前，在中国的农村和城市都有“啃老族” 2.这种现象产生的原因 3.如何应对这种现象 注：NEET是Not Currently Engaged in Education，Employment or Training或Not in Education，Employment or Trainin9的缩略语，即我们所说的“啃老族”。 高分范文 My View on NEET Now in China the problem of NEET has been brought into public attention.NEET refers to the group of people who are not currently engaged in education，employment or training，instead they just stay at home，relying on their parents. There are mainly two reasons for this phenomenon. For one thing， since the expansion of university enrollment in l999，an increasing number of college graduates have poured into the job—hunting market. However， some of them are not fully prepared and become unemployed. For another， some young people are the only child of their family and badly spoilt. As a result，they are psychologically dependent even when they grow up. To solve this problem，first, colleges or the communities should provide pre-job training courses for the young. Second，parents should cultivate their children’s sense of independence in their childhood. Last but not least，college students also have to equip themselves with skills and knowledge and get ready to compete tomorrow. 3.12 诚信贷款 Honesty in the Loan System 1.教育部展开对贫困生的贷款资助 2.很多学生不按期还贷款 3.你如何看待其中的诚信问题 高分范文 Honesty in the Loan System China’s Ministry of Education has carried out an education loan system for years. Government grants interest-free loan to millions of college students from poor families every year. However，some student debtors fail to repay their loans even many years after graduation. It is the national priority to push the whole education.in which students from poverty-stricken families have the right to be offered the money and the fair opportunities. Our government has a duty to provide and protect a comprehensive and high-quality education for its entire citizens. On the other hand，the students have to pay back the money after their school days. Otherwise，they，the loan defaulters，lose their credits， which is definitely not the result of our education. To be honest is the best policy. Students master the technical and survival skills，and they，first of all，have to learn to be a human. 3.13 即时消息 The Popularity of Instant Messaging Technologies 1.近来移动QQ、微信等通信方式在大学生中十分流行 2.这些通信方式有许多优点 3.我的观点 高分范文 The Popularity of Instant Messaging Technologies Recently，we can hear the melodious sounds of the lovely QQ penguin out of cell phones almost everywhere on campus. Those cell phone users are actually communicating with their friends through their mobile QQ. This new means of instant messaging technology has gradually gained its popularity among college students. Micro message, another form of instant messaging technology. Also receives vied usage among college cell phone users. In comparison with the text message usage. Mobile QQ is much cheaper. Users are only charged by the total network flows. As to micro—message. Users can send free text messages. What’s more. This mobile instant messaging technology also brings more convenience. With these mobile services，users do not need to type on the desktop computer or laptop. In consequence，without worrying about the cell phone fees， users are able to enjoy the pleasure of instant chatting almost everywhere. However，mobile instant messaging services should not be embraced wholly with open arms. When mobile QQ software’s are downloaded to cell phones，they can create a serious security breach，for crackers may plant virus in the program. 3.14 酒后驾驶 My View on Drunken Driving 1.最近酒后驾驶造成惨剧的报道频传 2.如何改变这种现象 3.我的看法 高分范文 My View on Drunken Driving It is shocking to notice that tragic accidents caused by drunken driving have occurred with high frequency recently. Four people were killed and one was seriously injured in Chengdu because of a young driver who had just been to a birthday party and got totally intoxicated with too much alcohol. How can we make a quick and effective stop to these unimaginable calamities? Some people claim that severe punishment，even the extreme penalty，will work effectively，since people seem to learn more from the similar bitter cases having previously happened; others believe that more importance should be attached to education，and civilized driving should be advocated among people. These suggestions do make sense and are actually in effect in many nations at present. In my opinion，the most important is the self-consciousness about the potential dangers to life drunken driving may cause. Only when one is aware that his life is being threatened，would he try to avoid doing so for self-protection. 3.15 大学校园暴力事件 My View on Campus Violence 1.近来不断有大学校园暴力事件发生 2.产生这些暴力事件的原因 3.我的看法 高分范文 My View on Campus Violence It is shocking to notice that extreme violence has occurred with frequency on campus in recent years. Several months ago，a university student hacked some of his classmates to death with a knife. Recently，a college student from a prestigious university stabbed a professor，who was preparing for his lecture，to death. These tragedies seem to be unimaginable when college students are regarded as the elite of the society. Some people claim that the higher education hasn’t attached due importance to moral education of the college students. Others believe that college students are fragile in their internal minds. These opinions do make sense when we take the overloaded pressure imposed on college students into consideration. In my opinion，it is more important to take measures to avoid such occurrences. Psychological aid is a solution. Those criminals on the campus may have the experience of being humiliated or facing a lot of pressure. Only through psychological consultation can they outlet their negative feelings and hence avoid extreme actions. 3.16 高价格等于高质量吗 Does High Price Equal High Quality? 1.有的人认为高价格等于高品质 2.也有人表示反对 3.在我看来…… 4.高分范文 Does High Price Equal High Quality? When asked about how to differentiate good products from bad ones， quite a number of people take it for granted that high price equals high quality. Confronted with uncertainty about the intrinsic value of the products. Consumers simply use the rule of thumb that they understand. They believe that high—quality products need high cost，resulting in high price. In a word，price reflects quality. However. Others who hold the opposite opinion argue that there is no necessary one-to-one correspondence between quality and price. Having been exposed to news about fake products and fraud, many customers come to realize that salesmen also charge high price for low-quality products. They are supported by a recent case that a famous luxury furniture brand is found to cheat customers with low-quality products. As far as I’m concerned. Only when business is transparent，honest and free from deception，can high price equal high quality. Therefore，in the current circumstance，we can’t determine the quality of one product solely by its price. 3.17 儿童教育 Directions：For this part. You are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay entitled My View on Early Childhood Education. Your essay should start with a brief description of the picture. You should write at least l50.words but no more than 200 words. 高分范文 My View on Early Childhood Education The he picture presents us a thought—provoking scene.in which a cock is standing on the platform，giving a lecture about higher mathematics. In front of the platform stands a desk，on which lies all egg which has not hatched into a chick. What an ironical drawing it is! It reveals that an increasing number of parents tend to put too much emphasis on their children’s preschool education. The reason why such phenomenon emerges can be interpreted as follows. On the one hand，from the parents’ perspective, children are likely to fall behind when competing with their counterparts if they don’t start learning early. On the other hand，since most of the parents today have suffered from lack of knowledge，the enthusiasm of learning more things is naturally transferred to the present generation. As far as I’m concerned. Such kind of early childhood education will pose pressure on the children’s physical and mental health. I suggest that parents should stop putting too much pressure on the children，and the children ‘education should be based on their nature-being happy. Only with the “natural law “can a child grow up healthily. 3.18 社会责任感 College Students ‘Social Responsibilities 1.许多大学生缺乏社会责任感，比如…… 2.造成这种现象的原因 3.大学生应如何履行自身的社会责任 高分范文 College Students ‘Social Responsibilities If you Google“the 71st Anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre”(in Chinese)on the Internet，you will be impressed by the video show of a girl’s special commemoration. After watching the video. I Was wondering where college students were. Taking into consideration their indifference to other historic events such as the May 4 Movement，we can conclude that college students lack the due social responsibilities. However，we should not simply criticize their indifference，and analysis should be made to reckon with underlying reasons. Firstly，college students are imposed excessive pressure by the job market. They have to pay more attention to their studies. Secondly，many students believe that the history has already been borne in mind，and it is unnecessary to commemorate historic anniversaries each year. For them，it is better to internalize the humiliated history and work hard than to hold ceremonies without concrete contents. To my way of thinking，college students should not keep silent on those occasions. It is our responsibilities to voice Our aspirations and let the society know that we have not forgotten the history. 3.19 如何看待买彩票 买彩票，有点像赌博，一方面是凭运气，一方面会上瘾。会有一种不甘心的心理在作祟，不甘心就中这么多，不甘心一个都没中。其实这来自于人们一种投机取巧的心态。 作文题目： 你对彩票游戏的看法 高分范文 Nowadays a fashionable street scene is the buying and selling of lottery tickets. People crowd around either in front of big buildings or at street corners, purchasing coupons of various kinds, such as those of social welfare, sports industry and football games. Investigations made among those “lottery citizens” show that they do it for different purposes. Some say that they play the game just for fun, others insist that they want to sponsor athletic development, still some others simply decide to try their luck. However, I believe the aim behind the game, if fully exposed, is to make easy money, as it is said the prize winner can get millions of yuan in an instant, which is obviously great temptation. In my mind, lottery is much the same as gambling in nature and it certainly brings more negative effects than positive effects, if any. First, the overwhelming majority, being misled by earning-quick-buck mentality, are impatient and impulsive to put their time and money into wrong investment. Secondly, not a few people, being indulged in lottery, lose not only initiative for work but also interest in life. Thirdly, some individuals, having gambled away all their money, may commit crimes. Fourthly, young people, particularly students (even pupils) may step by step become addicted to lottery and finally leave their studies. I think the cliche “reaping what one sows” is still applicable today and “sowing” takes time and hard work to have instant reaping is definitely one’s wishful thinking. Last of all, since gambling and lottery both mean risking money on luck, why the former is forbidden by law and the latter is so much encouraged? 3.20 海外留学有哪些利弊 作文题目： 1.海外留学的好处 2.海外留学也存在一些问题 3.我的观点 高分范文 Overseas Study The discussion about overseas study has never stopped in the past few years. Let‘s have a look at its advantages and disadvantages before drawing the final conclusion. The biggest advantage of studying overseas is the higher academic level and advanced research facilities. What’s more, by understanding a new culture and meeting different people, students can develop a more reasonable and balanced view towards the world. Last but not least, the experience will be invaluable to character building, which makes most students more independent, diligent and enterprising. However, the negative effects are also obvious. To begin with, if a person does not make full preparations before going abroad, he will have great difficulty adapting to the new environment. In the second place, the cultural differences will hinder the regular life in many ways. Finally, money is always a big problem. Many students have to find part-time jobs to earn money to pay tuition and fees. In conclusion, the advantages of overseas study outweigh disadvantages. Once they return home, the overseas students will make great contributions to our motherland.
